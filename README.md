# Catman's Custom

A fork of https://github.com/ModDota/TypeScriptAddonTemplate.

## Contents:

* **[src/common]:** TypeScript .d.ts type declaration files with types that can be shared between Panorama and VScripts
* **[src/vscripts]:** TypeScript code for Dota addon (Lua) vscripts. Compiles lua to game/scripts/vscripts.
* **[src/panorama]:** TypeScript code for panorama UI. Compiles js to content/panorama/scripts/custom_game

--

* **[game/*]:** Dota game directory containing files such as npc kv files and compiled lua scripts.
* **[content/*]:** Dota content directory containing panorama sources other than scripts (xml, css, compiled js)

--

* **[scripts/*]:** Repository installation scripts

## Continuous Integration

This template includes a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) [workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) that builds your custom game on every commit and fails when there are type errors.
